## üéØ **What This Bot Does**

This experimental bot monitors the **Zora Factory contract** on Base network for new creator coin launches, evaluates creators using **Ethos Network reputation scores**, and executes trades for qualifying creators.

### üîç **Core Strategy**
1. **Real-Time Monitoring** - Detects creator coins within seconds of launch
2. **Quality Filtering** - Only considers creators with established Zora profiles  
3. **Twitter Integration** - Requires connected Twitter accounts for reputation scoring
4. **Ethos Scoring** - Uses Twitter-based reputation scores (0-3000 range)
5. **Automated Trading** - Executes buy orders for qualifying creators (simulation mode available)

### üõ°Ô∏è **Triple-Layer Filtering System**
- **Profile Verification** - Must have valid Zora profile
- **Creator Coin Check** - Must be launching their official creator coin
- **Twitter Requirement** - Must have connected Twitter account
- **Ethos Threshold** - Must meet minimum reputation score
- **Freshness Filter** - Only processes events from AFTER bot startup

---

```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```env
# Base Network RPC (get from Alchemy, Infura, or QuickNode)
BASE_RPC_URL=https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY

# Trading Configuration
MIN_ETHOS_SCORE=750              # Minimum creator reputation (0-3000)

# SIMULATION MODE (MANDATORY FOR TESTING)
SIMULATION_MODE=true             # NEVER set to false without extensive testing

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=WARN                   # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR

```
üîç Bot initialized - will only process events created AFTER this moment
üìÖ Startup time: 2024-01-15T14:30:00.000Z
‚ö° Zero tolerance for historical events - only real-time detection!
üé≠ SIMULATION MODE ACTIVE - No real money will be spent

ü™ô FRESH COIN: CreatorCoin (CREATE) - 12s old
   üê¶ Checking Ethos for @creator123...
   üìä Ethos score: 1250 (HIGH)
   ‚úÖ QUALIFIES! Score 1250 ‚â• 750
üí∞ [SIMULATION] Created position for CreatorCoin
```

---

## üìä **Understanding the Bot's Behavior**

### üéØ **What Gets Filtered Out**
- **‚ùå No Zora Profile** - Creator has no established profile
- **‚ùå Not Creator Coin** - Not launching their official creator coin  
- **‚ùå No Twitter** - No connected Twitter account
- **‚ùå Low Ethos Score** - Below your minimum threshold
- **‚ùå Historical Events** - Events from before bot startup
- **‚ùå Old Events** - Events older than 2 minutes

### ‚úÖ **What Gets Processed**
- **‚úÖ Fresh Creator Coins** - Launched after bot startup
- **‚úÖ Established Creators** - Have Zora profiles with Twitter
- **‚úÖ High Reputation** - Meet your Ethos score threshold
- **‚úÖ Real-Time Events** - Detected within seconds of creation

### üìà **Ethos Score Guidelines**
- **2500-3000** - Ultra-high reputation (very rare)
- **1500-2500** - High reputation (selective)  
- **750-1500** - Medium reputation (balanced)
- **300-750** - Lower reputation (risky)
- **0-300** - Very low/no reputation (avoid)

deno task test-strict             # Test historical event filtering

# Test creator evaluation pipeline
deno task test-creator-flow       # End-to-end creator evaluation
deno task test-twitter            # Twitter profile extraction
deno task test-twitter-only       # Twitter-only filtering strategy

# Test logging and monitoring
deno task test-log-levels         # Demo different verbosity levels
deno task test-validation         # Test score validation ranges
```

### üìä **Simulation Mode Testing**
```bash
# Run simulation for extended periods
deno task start

# Monitor for at least 24-48 hours to understand:
# - Event frequency and types
# - Creator quality and scores

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Reference**

### üéõÔ∏è **Trading Parameters**
```env
MIN_ETHOS_SCORE=750              # Higher = more selective (0-3000)
TRADE_AMOUNT_ETH=0.001           # Per-position size (start small!)
MAX_POSITIONS=5                  # Risk management (start with 1-2)
TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENT=150.0        # Exit at +150% profit
STOP_LOSS_PERCENT=50.0           # Exit at -50% loss
MAX_HOLD_TIME_MINUTES=60         # Force exit after 1 hour
```

### üìä **Log Level Control**
```env
LOG_LEVEL=WARN   # Focused mode - shows activity + trades ‚≠ê
LOG_LEVEL=INFO   # Normal mode - includes detailed profile info  
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG  # Verbose mode - full debugging details
LOG_LEVEL=ERROR  # Quiet mode - errors only (too quiet for trading)
```

### üé≠ **Simulation vs Live Mode**
```env
SIMULATION_MODE=true    # Safe testing mode (recommended)
SIMULATION_MODE=false   # LIVE TRADING MODE (HIGH RISK!)
```

---

## üîß **Advanced Usage**

### üì± **Monitoring & Alerts**
The bot outputs structured logs suitable for monitoring:
```bash
# Filter for trades only
deno task start 2>&1 | grep -E "(FRESH COIN|QUALIFIES|Created position|Closed position)"

# Monitor with timestamps
deno task start 2>&1 | while read line; do echo "$(date): $line"; done
```

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Performance Optimization**
```bash
# Use optimized RPC endpoints
BASE_RPC_URL=wss://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY  # WebSocket preferred

# Adjust polling frequency in code if needed
# Faster detection but higher RPC usage vs slower but more stable
```

### üõ†Ô∏è **Custom Strategy Development**
The bot is designed to be extensible:
- **Edit `src/services/trading-bot.ts`** - Modify trading logic
- **Edit `src/services/ethos-service.ts`** - Add custom scoring
- **Edit `src/config/config.ts`** - Add new parameters

---

## üö® **Emergency Procedures**

### üõë **Stop Trading Immediately**
```bash
# Kill the bot process
Ctrl+C  # or Command+C on Mac

# Or kill by process if needed
pkill -f "deno.*zora-ethos-sniper"
```

### üí∞ **Emergency Position Management**
If you need to manually close positions:
1. **Check current positions** in your wallet
2. **Manually sell** on Zora frontend or DEX
3. **Document** any issues for future improvement

### üìã **Troubleshooting**
```bash
# Check configuration
deno task status

# Test RPC connection  
deno task test-ethos

# Debug event detection
deno task test-events

# Verify filtering logic
deno task test-strict
```

## üéØ **Final Reminders**

### ‚úÖ **Pre-Live Checklist**
- [ ] Tested in simulation mode for 24+ hours
- [ ] Reviewed and understood all trading logic
- [ ] Set appropriate risk limits (small amounts)
- [ ] Configured monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Have emergency stop procedures ready
- [ ] Understand tax and legal implications

### üö® **Risk Management**
- **Start small** - Use minimal amounts initially
- **Monitor constantly** - Don't run unattended for long periods
